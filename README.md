# Exploring UCDP Data 

This repository contains notebooks exploring a UCDP dataset. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) is the worldâ€™s main provider of data on organized violence and the oldest ongoing data collection project for civil war, with a history of almost 40 years.

The notebooks contains graphs, interactive maps as well as an attempt to predict the dangerousness of a region using several indicators. Data can be accessed [here](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/).
